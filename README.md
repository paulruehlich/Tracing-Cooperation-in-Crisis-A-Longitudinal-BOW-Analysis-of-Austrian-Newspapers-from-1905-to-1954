### Project Summary

This study investigates whether cooperation-related cultural values—such as prosociality, sympathy, and trust—anticipate or follow democratic transitions. We apply a longitudinal Bag-of-Words (BoW) text analysis to 43,289 issues (over 213,000 pages) of Viennese newspapers published between 1905 and 1954, spanning five distinct political regimes and two world wars.

Using validated psychological dictionaries adapted for German, we track changes in three cooperation-related semantic ratios:

- Prosociality vs. Authoritarianism  
- Sympathy vs. Anger  
- Trustworthiness vs. Strength  

Results show increased prosocial language during democratic regimes, sharp drops during wartime, and little evidence of anticipatory cultural shifts prior to democratization. This supports democratic learning theory over modernization theory.
